	/**
	 * @brief The SDK will ensure that, on clients and game server, every spawned ULocalPlayer instance has its UniqueNetId set as <NAME_None:BeamableGamerTag.AsString>.
	 *
	 * Under the hood, we use FUniqueNetIdString to do this as Beamable does not support OnlineSubsystems (because their interfaces are insufficient for supporting the key features of Beamable).
	 * We do this, because we use this to automatically map the Unreal connections in the server to Beamable GamerTags so we know which Beamable user is which automatically.
	 *
	 * We HIGHLY recommend keeping this enabled as this will make it so as the Beamable GamerTag is used as cross-platform UniqueNetId when developing Real-Time Multiplayer Games.
	 * This does NOT prevent usage of other OnlineSubsystems (such as Steam or platform ones) --- it just enforces that the UniqueNetId clients send to game servers when connecting is the Beamable GamerTag.
	 * In other words, this only affects your Replicated UniqueNetId for Real-Time Multiplayer purposes (@link ULocalPlayer::CachedUniqueNetId @endlink); it does not affect ANY ids you get through normal usage of Steam or other platform's OnlineSubsystems. 
	 *
	 * When you enable this flag we do the mapping for the Unreal Local Player to the Beamable UserSlot automatically in the client.
