White this version is considered a minor release, it brings a lot of new features and improvements to the Beamable Unreal SDK including a new Content Editor, new `OnlineSubsystemBeamable` features, and many bug fixes.

## New Content Editor

The Content Editor received a complete rework improving the usability and fixing many bugs. Now the content is presented in a list of itens improving the visualization of large amount of data; The filters were fixed on the top and all changes in the data are now updated properly with realtime feedbacks without need to reload the window manually. You can check the new Content Editor Documentation [here](../user-reference/beamable-services/content.md)

## New Unreal Documentation
![news-1.1.0-docs.png](../media/imgs/news-1.1.0-docs.png)
The Unreal Documentation was reorganized and improved to better guide the users on how to use the Beamable System in your project. More improvements in the Documentation of all Beamable Products are coming soon.

## Other Changes
- `OnlineSubsystemBeamable` plugin now supports Frictionless Authentication and Identity Attaching
- Samples are now selected by running `dotnet beam unreal select-sample BEAMPROJ_Name` instead of `BeamProjOverride.txt`
- `beam_init_game_maker.sh` will now try to remove any read-only flags of files inside the existing `Plugins/BeamableCore` folder.
  This is needed because UE's integrations with VCSs (Git, P4) will often lock binary files at the file system level; which then
  leads to our CLI being unable to replace the folder with newer versions (due to "access denied" problems). If you are using a VCS that
  makes files read-only at the file-system level, and you run into "access denied" issues when running this script, please make them not read-only and try again.
- `UBeamNotifications::TrySubscribeForMessage` now also accepts any type implementing `IBeamJsonSerializableUObject` for its message type.
  This enables usage of the `BeamGenerateSchema` attribute in microservice code to keep custom notification payloads in-sync between Microservice and UE code.

# Fixes
- Fixed issue that could cause an internal engine check to fail during editor startup in very rare cases (PostObjectLoad issue).
- Fixed issue that could cause a crash when re-logging into any particular UserSlot (a cleaned up operation could be waited on; no longer possible now)
- Fixed an issue that would cause a subsystem initialized with `UBeamRuntime::ManuallyInitializeSubsystem` to not load its user's data correctly if the user signed in **after** the system was initialized.
- Fixed multiple cases where the Content Screen did not update automatically after changes
