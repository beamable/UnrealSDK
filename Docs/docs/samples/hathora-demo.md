# Hatora Integration Sample

This demo, created from UE's FPS Template, show-cases how you can use the **Unreal SDK**, **OnlineSubsystemBeamable** and **Beamable Microservices** to integrate with Hathora (a game server orchestration provider).

## Introduction

Aside from our `BeamableCore` Plugin and assets from the FPS Template, here's what the sample contains:

- **`BEAMPROJ_HathoraDemo` Unreal Plugin.**: Contains the UE implementation for the game-server and client.
- **`Microservice/HathoraDemo` Microservice**: Microservice containing code that ties Beamable's matchmaking system and Hathora's Game Server Orchestration system.
- **Pre-Built Linux Dedicated Server Binaries**: Building dedicated servers is time-consuming so... we give you a build that can be configured via Environment Variables so you can test the sample as fast as possible.
- **`OnlineSubsystemBeamable/Customer/**` Extension**: Code added to the `OnlineSubsystemBeamable` plugin to extend our implementation of `IOnlineSubsystem` interfaces with code specific to the Hathora demo.

To set up this sample you'll need a few things:

- A Beamable Account and a Realm.
- A Hathora Account.
- A downloaded build (link to git-hub action artifacts of release tag build).

To configure the sample, run `dotnet beam unreal select-sample BEAMPROJ_HathoraDemo`.
## Setting up Beamable & Hathora
Since this sample requires several resources, we do not host it ourselves. So, in order to access the sample you'll need to configure a Beamable realm so you can use it.

1. Go to the Beamable Portal and create a new Beamable realm called `hathora-demo`.
2. Go to the Portal (`Account`) and set aside your Customer Id (CID).
3. Go to the Portal and set aside your realm's PID and Realm Secret (`Games -> YourGame -> hathora-demo`).
4. Compile and open the `BeamableUnreal` editor (it'll be configured as the `BEAMPROJ_HathoraDemo`) project.
5. Sign into your Beamable account and go to the `hathora-demo` realm.
	1. Hit `Apply to Build`.
6. Open the `Content Window`.
	1. Verify that there are two `game_types`: `solo_queue` and `training`.
7. Hit `Publish` and wait. 
8. Go to the Portal (`Operate -> Content`) and verify that the content is there.
9. Open a bash terminal at the `BeamableUnreal` root directory.
10. Run `dotnet beam project enable --with-group BEAMPROJ_HathoraDemo`
11. Run `dotnet beam project disable --without-group BEAMPROJ_HathoraDemo`
12. Guarantee `Docker` is open and running.
13. Run `dotnet beam deploy plan`. 
	1. This tells you details about the services you would deploy given your project's local state.
14. Run `dotnet beam deploy release --latest-plan`. 
	1. This deploys the services outlined by the generated plan in the previous command. 
15. Go to the Portal (`Operate -> Microservices`) to verify that the microservices have initialized.

Now, we'll go set up a Hathora account and upload the sample dedicated server build:

1. Log into your [Hathora](https://console.hathora.dev/) account.
2. Create an App and set aside its `AppId`.
3. In the Hathora Portal, go to `Profile -> Settings`.
4. Create and set aside [two tokens](https://hathora.dev/docs/guides/generate-developer-token): `game-server` and `matchmaking-server`.
5. Deploy a new version by uploading the .tar file we provided for the sample.
      1. Configure the `Instance Profile` as a "medium".
6. Set up the following environment variables with the values you set aside:
      1. `BEAMABLE_CUSTOMER_OVERRIDE` = `Your CustomerId (CID)`
      2. `BEAMABLE_REALM_OVERRIDE` = `Your hathora-demo Realm's PID`
      3. `BEAMABLE_REALM_SECRET` = `You hathora-demo Realm's Secret`
      4. `BEAMABLE_ENVIRONMENT_OVERRIDE` = `BeamProdEnv`
      5. `HATHORA_DEV_TOKEN` = `The game-server dev token`.
7. Make sure the `7777` UDP port is exposed.
8. Make sure that the number of rooms per processes is `1`.
9. Finish the deployment process and verify that the deployment was successful.

!!! note "Realms and Hathora"
	Hathora recommends users create one Hathora account per dev-environment. In Beamable, that is equivalent of having one Hathora account per Beamable Realm; one for **dev**, another for **staging** and yet another for **prod**. This is so you can have multiple deployments up at the same time for different purposes (the live deployment in **prod** vs a QA-testing build in **staging** and the current stable/nightly in **dev**).

Now that your Hathora account is configured to boot up our provided build, we need to configure the `hathora-demo` realm with the information it needs to correctly provision a server whenever a match is made.

1. Go to the Beamable Portal and open the Realm Config page of the `hathora-demo` realm (`Operate -> Config`).
2. Hit the `Add Config` button.
3. Set the following key-value pairs for the namespace `hathora_integration`.
      1. `app_id -> Your Hathora AppId`
      2. `dev_token -> Your matchmaking-server dev token` 

Now, you are ready to join a match through PIE.
## Playing the sample through PIE
In order to play the sample using a dedicated server in Hathora:

1. Set your `Multiplayer Options -> NetMode` to `Play as Standalone` and open the `Hathora Demo` map.
      1. If you can't find it, turn on `Content Browser -> Settings -> Show Plugin Content` and look inside the `BEAMPROJ_HathoraDemo` content folder.
2. Run PIE.
3. The first time you are running, type in an email/password and hit register. 
      1. In subsequent runs OR if you use the same email/password as your Beamable account, hit Login instead.
4. After you're signed in, hit the `Training` button and observe the logs. If you look at Hathora's Portal, you'll be able to see the server spinning up for you to play in. If you look at the your Microservice logs (`Operate -> Microservice -> HathoraDemo -> Logs`), you'll be able to see its communication with Hathora.
5. After a match is found --- 30 seconds later you'll connect to the actual server and see the match. 
6. Move around a while and then simply PIE.

!!! warning "Cold Starts"
	The first run of the application might time out due. If that happens, simply wait until you see a log line in the UE Log window that says "DeleteTicket" show up and simply re-join the queue.

To test this out with two players (this is max players for this sample):

1. Set your `Multiplayer Options -> NetMode` to `Play as Client` and your `Multiplayer Options -> Number of Players` to `2`.
2. Sign into different accounts in each PIE instance.
3. Hit the `Solo Queue` button instead of the `Training` one in both PIE instances.
4. Wait for a bit and both PIE instances will be matched against each other.
## Known Issue - Network Version Mismatch
There's a known issue that'll prevent you from actually getting PIE to connect to the Hathora URL; its an version mismatch problem with the Linux Build we generate. The error is called `OutdatedClient` --- and was seen even when the versions *should* be matching exactly. **This is being actively investigated** and a fix should be released in the next version.

**You can still see the entire flow happening.**
- If you look at your UE client logs, you can see that you correctly receive the lobby information with a valid Hathora connection string.
- If you look at your Hathora Console, you can see the room being created and even the connection attempt.

So there's still some value in looking into this sample in this version until this is fixed so we opted to release it anyway.

## Can I use it as a Template?

This sample is not meant to be used as a template directly, however, its components are free for you to copy and use in your own project. Here's what these are:

However, its Beamable code components are free for you to copy and use in your own project. Here's what these are:

- The HathoraDemo Microservice.
- Beamable code inside `BEAMPROJ_HathoraDemo` except code inside a `ThirdParty` directory.
- Content inside the `BEAMPROJ_HathoraDemo` except things inside a `ThirdParty` directory.

## Why don't we provide a client build?
Because clients must be pointed at your organization's `hathora-demo` realm. As such, you'd need to generate the build yourself, which you can do by packaging it normally for any of our supported platforms.
