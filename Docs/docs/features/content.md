# Content

## Overview 

Beamable's Content feature is a read-only (at runtime) arbitrary data store that you can
use to define your game's data. Several of Beamable's own managed features also
use content in some way or another.

## `UBeamContentObject` and Sub-types

In Unreal, you define content schemas as sub-classes of UBeamContentObject or any
of its sub-types available in the SDK ( UBeamItemContent , UBeamGameType , etc...). Every
content type must define a unique string id for that particular type and a function that
returns it.

The following example of UBeamCurrencyContent shows how that can be done:

```c++
UCLASS(BlueprintType)
class BEAMABLECORE_API UBeamCurrencyContent : public UBeamContentObject
{
	GENERATED_BODY()
public:
	// Define the ContentTypeId for this type.
	UFUNCTION()
	void GetContentType_UBeamCurrencyContent(FString& Result){ Result = TEXT("currency"); }
	
	// Define the properties you wish
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite)
	FBeamClientPermission clientPermission;
	
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite)
	int64 startingAmount;
	
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, DisplayName="Federation")
	FOptionalBeamFederation external;
};
```

Please remember to annotate your `UPROPERTY` with `EditAnywhere` and either:

- `BlueprintReadOnly` if you are not writing utilities to create the objects for you.
- `BlueprintReadWrite` if you are writing utilities to create the objects for you.

!!! note "Microservices"
	In a lot of cases, you will want to access these content objects in Microservices.	For all of Beamable's own content-types ( UBeamCurrencyContent , etc...) you will find equivalents in the Microservice SDK. For your own custom types, you'll need to declare them in C#. To do so, use the serialization table below as reference to know how to map types from C++ to C#.

Take a look at `UMockBeamContentObject` to see the supported types.

## Beamable's Content System
Beamable Content System allows you to define arbitrary JSON-serialized data for use
at runtime. The system is manifest-based and has no server-side schema enforcing
(which means you are solely responsible for maintaining backward compatibility for
your custom content objects).

Each individual content object in each manifest is identified by an ID with the format
below:

> ContentTypeId.ContentName

ContentType expands to the hierarchy of UBeamContentObject types, starting from the root type. For example:

> `UMyGameItemContent` inherits from `UBeamItemContent`
> `items.mygameitem.MyGameItemName`

The last part of the id is the only one you should edit through the **Content Window**.
### At Runtime
The SDK fetches the content manifest before the `OnBeamableStarted` callback is
triggered. By default, it downloads the content manifest and each individual piece of content. You can enable and disable this behaviour it can be configured to do so inside `Project Settings -> Beamable Runtime`.

![DownloadIndividualContent](./images/content-download-individual-on-start.png#center)

The SDK also supports automated content updates: once a user is signed into Beamable, our `UBeamContentSubsystem` begins to listen for notifications that the realm's content manifest has been updated from Beamable's server. If that happens, we will re-download the manifest. Again, we only download individual content pieces if that setting is on. There is an API you can use to manually download individual content pieces: `FetchIndividualContentBatchOperation` and `FetchIndividualContentOperation`.
### The Content Manifest
At any given time, a Beamable realm has one or more active Content Manifests. By default, and for most cases, the automatically created global manifest is the only one you need. To create, update and delete modify and access `UBeamContentObject` instances at authoring time, you need to:

1. Synchronize your local state with what's in the realm (**download** the manifest).
2. Create content JSON files inside the `.beamable/content` folder.
	1. The Content Window is the easiest way of doing so.
3. Synchronize your changes to the Realm (**publish** the manifest).

In Unreal, you interact with your content objects through the Content Window. It shows you the current state of content relative to your current realm and allows you:

- **Download:** Download the content files currently published to your realm. This is non-destructive; it **won't** discard new files, just restore deleted ones and discard changes of existing ones.
- **Reset**: This is a destructive version of download. After it ends, your local content will 100% reflect what's in the realm.
- **Publish**: This is the reverse-reset. It'll make your realm an 100% match to your local content.

This UX looks and follows what you expect of editing any `UObject`. The difference is that the `UBeamContentObject` instances are NOT stored inside your Unreal project. They are the `.json` files inside `.beamable/content` folder.
### Baking Content
In preparation for our Offline Mode support, we provide a editor utility that will bake a content manifest into a `UBeamContentCache`; this is a special asset type that has the `UBeamContentObject` instances serialized using UE's serialization as opposed to JSON. 

This is loaded automatically by the `UBeamContentSubsystem` if it exists and is configured correctly. We provide an editor utility blueprint you can run to generate and configure the cache for each of your content manifests. The `EBP_BakeContent` utility can be found in Beamable Core's plugin folder under `/Editor/Utility/EBP_BakeContent.EBP_BakeContent`.

!!! warning "I can't find the Beamable Core Content in the Content Browser"
	UE's Content Browser does not show Plugin content folders by default. If you want to see these, you need to turn it on at `Content Browser -> Settings -> Show Plugin Content`.

Running this utility goes through each of your manifests (`.beamable/content/{manifest}`) and turns them into `BCC_` assets ( `UBeamContentCache` ) stored in `/Game/Beamable/Content/Manifests/Cooked/` directory.
