# Content

## Overview 
Beamable's Content feature is a read-only (at runtime) arbitrary data store that you can
use to define your game's data. Several of Beamable's own managed features also
use content in some way or another.

## `UBeamContentObject` and Sub-types
In Unreal, you define content schemas as sub-classes of `UBeamContentObject` or any
of its sub-types available in the SDK ( `UBeamItemContent` , `UBeamGameTypeContent` , etc...). Every
content type must define a unique string id for that particular type and a function that
returns it.

The following example of `UBeamCurrencyContent` shows how that can be done:

```c++
UCLASS(BlueprintType)
class BEAMABLECORE_API UBeamCurrencyContent : public UBeamContentObject
{
	GENERATED_BODY()
public:
	// Define the ContentTypeId for this type.
	UFUNCTION()
	void GetContentType_UBeamCurrencyContent(FString& Result){ Result = TEXT("currency"); }
	
	// Define the properties you wish
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite)
	FBeamClientPermission clientPermission;
	
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite)
	int64 startingAmount;
	
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, DisplayName="Federation")
	FOptionalBeamFederation external;
};
```

Please remember to annotate your `UPROPERTY` with `EditAnywhere` and either:

- `BlueprintReadOnly` if you are not writing utilities to create the objects for you.
- `BlueprintReadWrite` if you are writing utilities to create the objects for you.

!!! note "Microservices"
	In a lot of cases, you will want to access these content objects in Microservices.	For all of Beamable's own content-types ( `UBeamCurrencyContent` , etc...) you will find equivalents in the Microservice SDK. For your own custom types, you'll need to declare them in C#. To do so, use the serialization table below as reference to know how to map types from C++ to C#.

Take a look at `UMockBeamContentObject` to see the supported types.

## Beamable's Content System
Beamable Content System allows you to define arbitrary JSON-serialized data for use
at runtime. The system is manifest-based and has no server-side schema enforcing
(which means you are solely responsible for maintaining backward compatibility for
your custom content objects).

Each individual content object in each manifest is identified by an ID with the format
below:

> ContentTypeId.ContentName

`ContentType` expands to the hierarchy of `UBeamContentObject` types, starting from the root type. For example:

> `UMyGameItemContent` inherits from `UBeamItemContent`
> `items.mygameitem.MyGameItemName`

The last part of the id is the only one you should edit through the **Content Window**.

### Content Window
The content window is how you can create and edit content inside the editor. Here's what it looks like:

![](images/content-window.png#center)

!!! note "Where can I find the content files?"
	 While you edit the content objects as `UObject` and a details panel, these are not stored as `UDataAsset` or anything inside Unreal itself. These are stored as individual JSON objects inside `ProjectRoot/.beamable/content/global` folder. This makes it more VCS-friendly.

#### Creating and Deleting Content
To create a new piece of content, you should:

1. Select a content type from the **Content Type** dropdown.
2. Type in a name for the content; it cannot contain whitespaces or `.`.
3. Click the `Create` button.

After that you should see a new content of that type which you can edit. **Deleting** content can be done simply by selecting one and pressing `Del` on your keyboard.
#### Visualizing Content
The list of content objects displayed in the content window is very similar to a "Status" window in Git or some other VCS system. It isn't just showing you your local state; it is showing you the differences between your local state and the state in your currently targeted `Realm`.

These differences are represented by the `[+]`, `[M]`, `[NC]` and `[-]` signs. 

- `[+]`: Means the content exists locally but NOT in the realm.
- `[M]`: Means the content exists BOTH locally and in the realm AND that it is modified relative to the one in the realm.
- `[NC]`: Means the content exists BOTH locally and in the realm AND that it has no changes relative to the one in the realm.
- `[-]`: Means the content DOES NOT exists locally but DOES exist in the realm.

![](images/content-window-statuses.png#center)

The window will display these sorted by these status types in the following order: `[+]` first, then `[M]` and `[NC]`, followed by `[-]` last.

!!! warning "Changing Realm"
	Changing Realms does NOT auto-sync your local content with that realm's content. This means that you will see changes to these (`[+]`, `[M]`, `[NC]`, `[-]`) signs to reflect their new status against the new target realm.
#### Download & Publish
**Download** is pretty straight-forward, it'll fetch the content in the realm, replacing any `[M]` and restoring any `[-]` values to match the ones in the realm. It is similar to selecting all non-new files in a version control and "discarding changes".

**Publish** is similar to a commit. This will make the content in the realm the same as your local content. After publish, all pieces of content will match the realm and `[-]` content should disappear. Unless you **publish** your content, Beamable system's won't be able to see changes made to them; so don't forget to publish before testing your changes.

!!! warning "Sharing Realms between Designers"
	At the moment, we recommend each designer working in content have their own realm. This is because **publishing is an atomic process**. It'll replace the entire content in the realm with whatever is being published. 
	
	This means designers might accidentally override their changes if they don't **Download** before publishing and/or are editing the same objects.

### At Runtime
The SDK fetches the content manifest before the `OnBeamableStarted` callback is
triggered. By default, it downloads the content manifest and each individual piece of content. You can enable and disable this behavior it can be configured to do so inside `Project Settings -> Beamable Runtime`.

![DownloadIndividualContent](images/content-download-individual-on-start.png#center)

The SDK also supports automated content updates.

While signed into Beamable, `UBeamContentSubsystem` listens for notifications that the realm's content manifest has been updated. If that happens, we will re-download the manifest. If the SDK is configured to download individual content pieces automatically, we do so for all changed content.

If you disable this setting and want to control fetching the actual content objects yourself, there are APIs you can use to manually download individual content pieces: `FetchIndividualContentBatchOperation` and `FetchIndividualContentOperation`.

### Baking Content
In a couple of cases, you might want to bake content to distribute it with your build:

- If you plan to release a new build every time you want to update your game.
- If you want to trade-off some binary size for spending less time waiting for the individual content download at initialization time.

To enable those cases, we provide an editor utility that will bake your local content into a `UBeamContentCache`; this is a special asset type that has the `UBeamContentObject` instances serialized using UE's serialization as opposed to JSON. **Keep in mind that this utility uses your local content; so make sure your content matches the realm's content before running it**.

The utility is called `EBP_BakeContent` and can be found in Beamable Core's plugin folder under `/Editor/Utility/EBP_BakeContent.EBP_BakeContent`. Running this utility goes through your local content and bakes them into a `BCC_` assets ( `UBeamContentCache` ) stored in `/Game/Beamable/Content/Manifests/Cooked/` directory. This directory is configured, by default, to be included in packaged games.

!!! warning "I can't find the Beamable Core Content in the Content Browser"
	UE's Content Browser does not show Plugin content folders by default. If you want to see these, you need to turn it on at `Content Browser -> Settings -> Show Plugin Content`.

At runtime, any `UBeamContentCache` is loaded automatically by the `UBeamContentSubsystem` if it exists and is configured correctly; so you don't have to do anything to have it work.
