## About

Beamable's Store feature enables game developers to create an in-game storefront where users can purchase items using virtual currency.

!!! note "Purchases IAP support"
    Beamable supports purchasing listings using in-game IAPs, but for the Unreal SDK, this feature is not yet available. It will be added in future releases.

### Content Types

In Unreal Stores are represented by `UBeamStoreContent` class, which includes a store title and a list of links to `UBeamListingContent` types. The `UBeamListingContent` class contains all the details about the offer, such as player requirements, costs, and benefits. Both `UBeamStoreContent` and `UBeamListingContent` are subclasses of `UBeamContentObject`.

### Beam Store Subsystem

Purchases and operations on listings are handled through the `UBeamStoreSubsystem`. This subsystem allows the creation of a Purchase Listing Operation, which can then be committed to the Beamable servers. It also provides helper functions to retrieve detailed data from listings, making it easier to interact with store content.

## Getting started

The purpose of this guide is for game makers to setup a first store purchase using Beamable.

!!! note "Guide assumptions"
    This guide assumes that game maker already has project with Beamable SDK up and running. If that is not the case please follow [Getting Started Guide](../../guides/intro) first.

First open Beamable Content window and create a new Listing content:

![unreal-beamable-content-listing](./images/store-content-listing.png)

Then create a new Store content and add previously created listing as one of available ones in Store:

![unreal-beamable-content-listing](./images/store-content-store.png)

Then in Blueprint purchase can be performed like this:

![unreal-beamable-nodes](./images/stores-beam-nodes.png#center)

This is enough to perform a first purchase.
