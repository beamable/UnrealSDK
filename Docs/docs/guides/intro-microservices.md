## Getting Started with C# Microservices
To get started with Microservices in your project, you need a couple of things:

- Most Unreal `.[vcs]ignore` file templates will ignore all `*.sln` files. Instead of doing that, make sure to only ignore in the root directory with this  `/*.sln` instead of `*.sln`.
	- You can also just ensure your Microservice `.sln` is not ignored explicitly.
- Ensure you have the Beamable CLI installed.

Creating your first microservice will automatically create your solution for you. Following the guide below will generate the following recommended folder structure:

```
/repo-root
|- ProjectName.uproject
|- ProjectName.sln
|- ProjectNameMS/
|-- ProjectNameMS.sln
|-- services/
|--- MicroserviceName/
|---- MicroserviceName.csproj
```

Open a terminal/shell at your project's root and run the following command to create a new project and add a new microservice.
```
dotnet beam project new service MicroserviceName --sln ProjectNameMS/ProjectNameMS.sln
```

Then, run the following command to link the newly created project to your UE project.
```
dotnet beam project add-unreal-project .
```

Linking a project informs the Microservice project that, whenever it recompiles the microservices, it 
should re-generate a `ProjectNameMicroserviceClients` UE plugin inside your `Plugins/` directory. 

>Add this plugin as a dependency to any project/plugin you have from which you want to make calls to your microservices (don't forget to add it to `Target.cs` files as needed).
>
>Call `ProjectNameMicroserviceClients.AddMicroserviceClients(this)` on any of the `Build.cs` files you have and want to communicate with a microservice.

Here are the constraints around these generated clients:
- They follow the same pattern as our Auto-Generated UE APIs and are generated from the Microservice's OAPI docs. 
- They'll ONLY generate types that are found in `[________Callable]` methods of your Microservices.
- The generated Plugin is NOT editable by the user (it gets destroyed/recreated with every new generation).
- In general, the type-mapping seen in the [Content section](../features/content.md#supported-content-serialization) is what you can expect.

!!! note "Customize the Generation?"
	We do have plans to enable you to declare the intent to generate a particular type via an attribute in the future. However, actually customizing the outputted code is unlikely as it is already simple enough to write wrapper around it should you want a different style interface.

#### Simple Example
 Here's the sample code for a simple microservice that adds two integers together:
```csharp
public class MSPlayground : Microservice  
{  
    [ClientCallable]  
    public int Add(int a, int b)  
    {
	    return a + b;  
    }
}
```

Here's how you'd call that endpoint from inside Unreal.
```cpp 
// From inside any GameInstanceSubsystem, Actor or Component...

// Get the Generated API subsystem
const auto MsApi = GEngine->GetEngineSubsystem<UBeamMSPlaygroundApi>();  

// Create an instance of the generated Request object.
UMSPlaygroundAddRequest* Req = UMSPlaygroundAddRequest::Make(1, 2, GetTransientPackage(), {});  

// Declare the handler for the addition
const auto Handler = FOnMSPlaygroundAddFullResponse::CreateLambda([this](FMSPlaygroundAddFullResponse Resp)  
{  
    // If the request failed or we are retrying, we do nothing  
    if (Resp.State != RS_Success)  
       return;  
  
    // Otherwise, print the value 
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Display, TEXT("Microservice Add: %d"), Resp.SuccessData->Value);
});  

// Make the request (the user slot will usually be the UBeamCoreSettings::GetOwnerPlayerSlot())
FBeamRequestContext Ctx;  
MsApi->CPP_Add(UserSlot, Req, Handler, Ctx, {}, this);
```

For more information on how to write microservice code itself, take a look at our SAMS C# Microservices docs.
### Libraries and C# Microservices
One of the big advantages of Beamable C# Microservices is that they are regular `.NET` projects. This means you get access to Nuget packages should you need to integrate beamable with any particular Third-Party technology that we don't support out-of-the-box.

To do so, just use Nuget to add a package dependency to a project (this can be done easily through any IDE --- or through `dotnet nuget` command pallet).

In other cases, you might have a couple of services that share some logic. To write your own shared code inside this solution, all you need to do is create a `dll` project by running the following command and the adding a reference to it in any of your Microservice's `.csproj` files.

```
// Run the command to create the library
beam project new common-lib LibraryName --sln ProjectNameMS/ProjectNameMS.sln

// Add a reference to any Microservice's .csproj 
<ProjectReference Include="..\LibraryName\LibraryName.csproj"/>
```
### Databases: MicroStorages
To create a `MicroStorage`, run the command below.
```
beam project new storage StorageName --sln ProjectNameMS/ProjectNameMS.sln \
  --link-to MicroserviceName
```

The `link-to` option will make the given Microservice depend on the newly created storage. 

!!! warning "Running Locally"
	MicroStorages require you to ALWAYS have docker running when running locally. Microservices that **DO NOT DEPEND** on storages can be run directly from the IDE without docker running at all. Microservices that **DO DEPEND** on storages can also be run from the IDE, but docker MUST be running too.
